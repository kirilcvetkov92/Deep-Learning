Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms and train models 


Goals:

Code a deep (with at least 5 hidden layer) neural network in tensorflow
Fit it on the train dataset, estimate quality on the test dataset
Plot the train loss and test loss as a function of the training iteration number
Long description

My ultimate task for this part is to build your first neural network [almost] from scratch and pure tensorflow. This time I have the digit recognition problem as for the logistic regression assignment, but at a larger scale:

images are  28x28
10 different digits
50k samples
Note that you are not required to build 152-layer monsters here. A 2-layer (one hidden, one output) NN should already have an edge over logistic regression.

Some enthusiasm still ain't gone, I tried improving the test accuracy even further! The milestones are 95%/97.5%/98.5% accuracy on the test set.
